# 🧙🏻‍♂️✨ Ricardo Magalhães

**`iOS Engineer`**

I love to help shape products into elegant solutions for it's costumers. I love being involved in as much of the process as I can, that includes product discussions, getting asked for design opinion and finally implementing a solution through code.
Some of my greatest areas of interest are healthcare, mobility, sustainibility and any concept that affect peoples lives(productivity, time management), because I do believe we can make peoples lives better with software in most cases.
